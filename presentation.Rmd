## A general workflow for sports analytics {.build}

Determine the need through collaboration

Articulate the need as a question

Scope out the 'minimum viable product'

Allow time for peer review

Communicate the findings in appropriate ways

# Why use R for sports analytics? | (or similar programming languages)

## Excel: The power and pitfalls of an 'all-in-one' tool {.build}

Data, analysis outputs, and visualisation are stored in one place

Data is easily manipulated - high risk of introducing errors

Point-and-click interface - manual repetition

Actions are not logged

Slow when working with large data sets or files storing many computations

Excel workbooks can 'break' when shared with others

## The case for programming {.build}

Separation of data, analysis outputs, visualisations, and reports

Reproducible and transparent workflow

Procedures are documented via scripts and command history

R is free and open source: users benefit packages created by others

The R community is global and active - lots of help for when you get stuck!
